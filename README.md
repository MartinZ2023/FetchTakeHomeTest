To run the Files, you can download the zip file, and after un-zip the file, you will have a folder called FetchTakeHomeTest-Main, and inside the folder will be FetchTakeHomeTest. Go ahead and open this folder inside the Lastest Xcode, and you can run the program in simulator/iphone. It supports the IOS 15+ systems. 

Notice that, for the solely purpose of the take home test, I did not implement a beautiful UI. But the interface is user friendly. And it covers 2 major functionality by calling the TheMealDB API. 
1. Display a list of Dessert in the alphabetical order.
2. By clicking a specific Dessert, it will provides more details of the dessert including (Name, ingredients and instructions)

Thank you for your time!
